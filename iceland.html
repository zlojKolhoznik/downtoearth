        <span class="small-header-1">Everybody needs power.</span>
        But some ways we generate & use power can have a dramatic effect on the enviroment.
        This <span>Energy Awareness Web-Page</span> provides a number of clues and tips how to make smart energy choises,
        save money and have less impact on enviroment.

    <p>
        <span class="small-header-2">Energy literacy:</span>
        Energy Literacy is an understanding of the nature and role of energy in our lives and the
        ability to apply this understanding to answer questions and solve problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="small-header-2">Energy efficiency:</span>
        More than 90% of the energy we use comes from fossil fuels that are nonrenewable
        and cause pollution. One of the greatest energy resources we have at our fingertips is energy efficiency, or
        the energy that would otherwise be wasted. Choose the most energy-efficient equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="small-header-2">Renewable energy:</span>
        Renewable energy does not pollute the environment and can be continually
        replenished. Here are some of the major renewable resources being used today:
    </p>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div class="plant"></div>
        <p>
            <span class="small-header-2">Biomass</span>
            is any organic material that can be burned or converted to ethanol or methane.<br>
            Ethanol is used as vehicle fuel, and methane is captured from decaying garbage and waste<br>
            to produce energy.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div class="windstation"></div>
        <p style="margin-top: 45px;">
            <span class="small-header-2">Wind</span>
            energy is used to turn the blades connected to a turbine to proudce electricity.
            Many places have wind resources powerful and steady enough to harness.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div class="sun"></div>
        <p>
            <span class="small-header-2">Solar</span>
            energy is the Sun's radiant energy that can be absorbed, stored, and released by
            subctances or converted directly into electricity using photovoltaig (PV) cells.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div class="geothermal"></div>
        <p>
            <span class="small-header-2">Geothermal</span>
            energy is produced in the Earth's core. Low-temperature geothermal can be used
            to heat and cool building interior spaces. High-temperature geothermal resources are recovered
            with wells or pipes deep underground and can be used to heat buildings or produce electricity.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div class="water"></div>
        <p>
            <span class="small-header-2">Hydropower</span>
            is one of the oldest power sources on the planet. Flowing water, directed through
            a dam or other structure, is used to spin a wheel or turbine to produce electricity or for mechanical
            tasks like grinding grain. Scientists and engineers are also working to develop new hydrokinetic
            technologies to produce electricity from the motion of waves, tides, and river or ocean currents.
