	<h2 style="position: relative;text-align: center;" class=:main-header-2">FRESH WATER
Satellites See Everything from
Raindrops to Great Lakes</h2>
    <p><span class="small-header-1">Lake Mead</span> has lost
22.52 trillion liters
(5.95 trillion gallons) of
water – that is enough
water to fill over 9 million
Olympic-sized pools and
could circle the globe.</p>
<p><span class="small-header-1">Lake Baikal</span> is the
world’s deepest
lake. At more than
1,600 meters (5,000
feet) deep, its depth
is almost equal
to the combined
heights of the
Empire State Building in New York
City, the Burj Khalifa
building in Dubai,
and the Eiffel Tower
in Paris.</p>
<p><span class="small-header-1">A rainforest with snow?</span>
Olympic National Park is
full of rare temperate rainforests, but also receives
up to 10.7 meters (35 feet)
of snow per year.</p>
    <h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;" class="small-header-1">Ring Around
the Reservoir</h3>
    <p>Lake Mead is the largest freshwater
reservoir in the United States.
When full, it can hold 36 trillion
liters (9.3 trillion gallons) of water. But it
has been a long time since Lake Mead has
held that much water, and it looks very
different today than it did 32 years ago.
Looking down from space, a thin tan line
traces the shore of the lake, and the line is
getting thicker. What is happening?</p>
<p>People in the southwestern United
States live in a dry climate and rely on this
reservoir. Lake Mead reservoir has provided water for drinking and other uses
for millions of people in Nevada, Arizona,
and California. For instance, farmers in the
Imperial Valley of California use about 3.8
trillion liters (1 trillion gallons) of water
from the reservoir each year to irrigate
farmland and grow 85 percent of the winter
vegetables consumed in the U.S. But what
is different today?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 45px;" class="small-header-1">A River Runs Through It</p>
<p>Lake Mead is part of the Colorado River
watershed. Most of the water in the lake
comes from snow melting in the Rocky
Mountains and flowing down the hills into
the river. The river also collects rainfall
that runs off the land. But lately, there
has been less snow and rain falling in the
mountains and less water in the river. For
the past 16 years, the reservoir has not
been refilling like it did in the past.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 45px;" class="small-header-1">Double Hitter –
Drought and Heat</p>
<p>The southwestern United States has
received less rainfall than normal since the
year 2000. This means that people, particularly farmers, have had to use more of the
water that was saved in the reservoir. Heat
is also a problem. Record high temperatures in the area are causing the fresh water
to evaporate.<p>
<p style="margin-top: 45px;" class="small-header-1">Shrinking Shoreline</p>
<p>This is not the first drought to shrink
Lake Mead. Droughts in the 1950s and
1960s increased the use of water from the
lake. But in 2016, the lake reached a record
low. The last time Lake Mead was this low
was in 1937, when the reservoir was first
filling up. By July 2016, Lake Mead was
only 36 percent full, and the water level
had dropped almost 42 meters (138 feet)
from the average level in 1984. From
space, this shrinking shoreline looks like a
large bathtub ring.</p>
    <h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center;" class="small-header-1">Sipping SNOW
in the SIERRAS</h3>
<p>When people think of
water, they don’t
usually think of
snow. But snow is water. Some
of the water you drink may even
have been snow.
Snow is made up of tiny,
frozen water crystals and air.
When snow melts, the water flows
downhill and accumulates in
streams, rivers, and underground
aquifers. Some of this snowmelt
ends up in reservoirs, where it is
stored for people to use.
In the western United States,
nearly 75 percent of the freshwater
supply comes from snowmelt stored
in reservoirs. A reservoir is like a
bank account or piggy bank. Water
is taken out of the bank in the summer
and fall, and nature fills it back up in
the winter and spring.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 45px;">The larger problem is that less
water is being added to the reservoirs
and aquifers. As snow melts it
gradually fills the aquifers and
reservoirs. Snowmelt adds fresh
water to aquifers and reservoirs
even during dry seasons. When
there is less snow covering the
mountains, there may not be
enough snowmelt to replenish
aquifers and reservoirs through
California’s dry summers.
2015 was a warm and dry
winter. The lack of snow and rain
caused California to restrict the
amount of water people could
use in the summer of 2015. Some
farms in southern California had
to use water from Lake Mead
(in Nevada) to make up for the
lack of water in their reservoirs.
Read more in “Ring Around the
Reservoir” (page 4).
The winter of 2016 was better,
with more snow and rain in
parts of California due to
El Niño. Snowmelt in 2016 did
a lot to pay back the water
supply, but after years of
drought, there is still less water
in California’s reservoirs than
in the past.</p>
    <h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center;" class="small-header-1">Notes from the Field. Soaking up Science in the Rainforest</h3>
	<p>Precipitation–rain, snow, and ice–gives us
the fresh water we need to survive.
Scientists can measure precipitation from
the ground using rain gauges, radar, and other
weather instruments. But they can’t make such
measurements all over the planet because they
cannot get to many remote places. Over 70
percent of Earth is covered by oceans, and the
only reliable way to measure how much
precipitation falls there is to do it from space.</p>
<p>Satellites can give us a big picture of where,
when, and how much precipitation is falling
around the world. The Global Precipitation
Measurement (GPM) mission measures how
much precipitation is falling around the world,
and it gives us an updated amount every three
hours! But we need scientists to compare the
measurements from the satellite with measurements from the ground to verify the accuracy of
the satellite’s data.</p>
<p>A group of scientists have been working
together to do just that in Washington. From
October 2015 through May 2016, scientists with
OLYMPEX (the Olympic Mountains Experiment)
carefully measured different forms of rain,
snow, and sleet that fell over the Pacific Ocean
and across the Olympic Peninsula and Olympic
Mountains.</p>
<p>This region gets 250 to 450 centimeters
(100 to 180 inches) of precipitation a year,
making it one of the few rainforests outside
of the tropics. That made it an ideal location to
see how accurately the satellite could measure
different types of precipitation.</p>
<p>The team used many types of instruments
on the ground, including rain gauges, advanced
weather radars, and weather balloons. In some
locations, they had to hike in and use mules to
help carry equipment because there weren’t
any roads!</p>
<p>Joe Zagrodnik, a graduate student from the
University of Washington, had some exciting
adventures as he worked to set up the instruments.
One of the storms created a mudslide that washed
out the road, and Joe and others needed picks and
shovels to clear the debris so they could continue
on their way!</p> 
<p>In another storm, Joe had to cross a river with water up to his knees. It was also hard to
protect the instruments and keep them running as
the rain kept falling.</p>
<p>Dr. Lynn McMurdie was surprised by a major
snowstorm that brought close to 240 cm (almost 8
feet) of snow in late December. A team of National
Park rangers and graduate students who were
assisting in the campaign had to hike, ski, and use
snowshoes to dig out the equipment and recharge
the batteries.</p>
<p>So the next time you are outside in the rain
or snow, think about how satellites and scientists
are counting those drops and flakes. The GPM
mission tells us how much freshwater is falling
to Earth every three hours for almost the
entire planet.</p>
